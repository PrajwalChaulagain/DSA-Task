/**
 * Summary:
 * The algorithm employs a combinatorial approach using Pascal's Triangle to determine the minimum
 * number of measurements needed to identify the critical floor efficiently. The approach works
 * by calculating how many floors can be tested using a given number of trials and test objects.
 * The algorithm iteratively increases the number of trials until it covers the required floors.
 *
 * The algorithm functions as expected, providing optimal results for different test cases.
